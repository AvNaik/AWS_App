# AWS_App

Android App for Communicating with AWS RDS (SQL Database) through AWS Lambda Service.

The Emotion entered through thte App will have the stamps of Location (taken through GPS) ,Date and Time concatenated to it and sent to the SQL Database over AWS through Lambda Services.

The very list of emotions can then be used to query the Database (again through Lambda Services).
